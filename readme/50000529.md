# OpenLedgerHQ
* In this guide, I will cover these methods to install Openledger Worker Node: **1.Chrome-Extension** **2.Windows** **3.Linux (CLI)**
* We can add as many nodes as we want to our dashboard
* Rewards rate for each Node:

* Maximize Activity: Ensure your node stays online and actively participates in the network to reach the hourly cap.
* Network Uptime is Critical: Downtime or uninstalled nodes will result in point loss.

# Register Dashboard
* Login to **[Dashboard](https://testnet.openledger.xyz/?referral_code=bdqbx4mw44)** with gmail

* We have different available installation methods you can choose in App-Store

## 🟠 Node Installation (Chrome Extension)
**1. Login to [Dashboard](https://testnet.openledger.xyz/?referral_code=bdqbx4mw44)**

**2. Install [Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/openledger-node/ekbbplmjjgoobhdlffmgeokalelnmjjc) and login**

> If you already have a Linux VPS without a GUI desktop, you can run extension node by installing Chromium browser: [Install Chromium Browser on Linux VPS](https://github.com/0xmoei/Install-Linux-Browser)
>
> Or you can buy a cheap server for $5/m from [Hostbrr](https://github.com/0xmoei/Linux_Node_Guide/blob/main/buy-vps.md). Note that you can install Windows on these servers

## 🟠 Node Installation (Windows)
Through this method, I install multiple Nodes on my Windows-Server VPS and an idle PC

**1. Download Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install)**

**2. Install Docker , then Restart your system**

**3. Enable WSL using only *Step.1* of this [Guide](https://github.com/0xmoei/Install-Linux-on-Windows?tab=readme-ov-file#step-1-enable-wsl)**

**4. Run Docker (no need to login), and wait until Docker Engine starts running**

**5. [Download](https://testnet.openledger.xyz/app-store), unzip and install Openledger Node (Windows Version)**
